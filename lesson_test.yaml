              *A successful shot is more than a well composed image.* A shot with a goal progresses the story and provides specific information that supports the goal of the sequence.

              # Solution
              ![Example of a wide shot providing a clear location](2.png)
              Each shot type has specific goals it is best suited to achieve. You may be able to explain your location with other shot types, but the wide shot is the easiest option to do it successfully. For example, wide shots are filmed far away from a subject. This distance often provides a clear image of the area around the subject, which is why it is effective to depict the location.

            text: Each type of shot has a goal that also answers a specific question about the story as well. By shooting a complete set of shot types, you can allow yourself to focus on a separate part of the story with each shot, and as a group they will tell a complete story.

            text: Only try to accomplish one goal per shot when you are first learning. A sequence is more successful with two shots that each do a good job of achieving one goal, than to have one shot that does a bad job of achieving two goals.

            text: It is best to experiment with this at first, and expect to fail more often than it works. Do not get discouraged. It is a challenging skill and each goal you add to a shot makes it significantly harder to be successful.

              ## Tips:  
                
              &bull; Typically used once in a scene, usually at the beginning.  
              &bull; Has a sense of the feel of the location.  
              &bull; To use multiple times you should be showing a dramatic change to the location. For example, an empty town square to a full town square is a successful use of two location shots.

              # Things to Remember  
                
              ![The subject matter should be 50% of the screen focus](13.png)  
              The subject matter should be 50% of the screen focus.  
                
              Consider the Hitchcock rule from video basics when you are considering your goal. Ask yourself if the most important element,  the primary goal of your shot is clearly visible.

              The rule of thirds is there to help you arrange the elements in your frame so that they are successful. Use the four point system from it to ensure your goals are clear.
