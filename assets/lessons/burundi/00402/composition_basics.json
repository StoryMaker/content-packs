The world can look very different in a photograph. This requires you to think visually, which can be a challenge for even the best journalists.  \n",

Creating distinct layers in your frame \u2014 foreground, middleground, and background \u2014 helps you tell more complex visual stories with your photography. You might choose to place your subject, a farmer whose fields are barren because of drought, frame left in the foreground and his dried up empty field in the background. This will give the image a clear subject layer (foreground) and context (background layer).  \n",

The most powerful photographs are taken at the split second when all the compositional elements come together and the action in the scene is at its most dramatic. This is called the moment of peak action. The best photographers have great anticipation. They will often set up to take advantage of key compositional elements and then wait for the moment of peak action.  \nA little care in composition and thoughtfulness about the information you need to convey to tell the story will go a long way toward making better photographs.  \n",
