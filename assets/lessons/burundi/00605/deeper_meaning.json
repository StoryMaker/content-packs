They speak to the universal human experience, the fundamental challenges we all face in life. And they do it in a way that audiences can relate to. It might be about lost love, a moral dilemma, economic struggle, triumph toward a dream, or confronting death. This is what the story is really about and is what gives a story impact. Every good story is built on something deeper than the immediate climax.  \n",

They threaten to burn the whole village if he does not give himself up. Central question: Will the man give himself up? Climax: He gives himself up and knows he will be killed, but the village will be saved. Deeper meaning: Some people put their community before themselves. Another deeper meaning here is: Sometimes the few are sacrificed to save the many.  \n&bull; In a presidential race, a politician is considering running against his brother. Central question: Will he challenge his brother? Climax: Yes, he enters the race. Deeper meaning: Sometimes ambition is stronger than loyalty.  \n&bull; In a local measles outbreak. Central question: will the disease spread outside the community? Climax: Parents keep all infected children in the community at home until they are all no longer infectious. Deeper meaning: Sometimes we need to act together to solve problems.  \n",
