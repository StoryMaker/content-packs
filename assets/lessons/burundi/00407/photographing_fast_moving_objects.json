A camera\u2019s ability to freeze action is controlled by the shutter. If the shutter speed is too slow, it cannot adequately freeze action. The image appears blurry because the sensor is recording the movement. Shutter speeds are typically measured in fractions of a second. The faster the action, the faster the shutter speed needs to be.  \n",

This can mean choosing a time of day when there is sunlight. It might also mean choosing a location where there will be the most light possible \u2014 near a street light, stage light, or in the headlights of a car.  \n",

This is true not only when shooting fast-moving objects. Always hold the camera close to your body. This is will make it easier to stabilize than if your arms are fully extended. It may help to rest the elbow of your camera hand on your knee or on an object to stabilize your camera.  \n",

            "text": "(10.png)  \n# Change your Angle to the Movement  \nThe most difficult movement for the camera is when your subject is moving across the frame from right to left or left to right. A common technique for handling this situation is called panning. Point your camera and follow the subject as it goes by, twisting your body if you have to. This reduces the relative speed of the movement in relation to the camera. You can also change your angle so the subject comes at the camera on an angle instead of across the frame. This will allow the camera to track the object better and freeze the action.  \nThe subject of your photo should always be in focus. Remember to manage the limitations of your equipment and the lighting conditions. Football players, vehicles and other moving objects may vary their speed. They might move into and out of greater light sources. Position yourself for the most advantageous moment to get your photo when the subject is well illuminated and moving comparatively slowly.  \n",
