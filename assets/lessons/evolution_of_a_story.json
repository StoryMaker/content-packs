Think in terms of reporting the basic facts and interviewing sources in your coverage that get to the key information immediately. Breaking news stories are sometimes referred to as first-day stories if there will be follow-up coverage as the event unfolds.

One key difference from breaking stories is that journalists have the opportunity to do pre-reporting for event stories. This allows you to present more background information in your story or as links. It might also allow you time to talk to more people, perhaps including an expert voice or someone with an opposing viewpoint. Ask yourself what information and sources will help the reader better understand the issue. The medium you use can be determined by the story. For example, if the story has strong visual elements, video may be the best tool.  \n",

Here are some tips for producing ongoing coverage that evolves with the story:  \n&bull; What\u2019s new and what\u2019s now: News updates need to be short and informative. Get to the point and get to it quickly. Your post should include the basic facts and most current information.  \n&bull; Show and tell: While some stories are tough to visualize, others may lend themselves to photos, video, or audio. Choose the right medium or combination of media to tell your story. Do not forget to keyword and tag multimedia content.  \n&bull; Dateline: Be sure to present exactly where and when the post and story covered were produced.  \n&bull; Links to more information: This can be a Twitter feed or a YouTube video or a link to a previous posts or links to coverage from other news outlets. Consider using hashtags if they are relevant to your platform.  \n&bull; Cite your sources: Let viewers know where your information is coming from \u2014 eyewitness accounts, an official spokesperson, your own observation, or other news sources. Transparency is key.  \n&bull; Cultivate contribution: Encourage people to contribute to your reporting. Make it easy for them to comment. Promote more discussion with the goal of better information for all.  \n&bull; Present your information in a logical order for the audience. Analysis about the causes of a power outage in the capitol should not precede breaking news coverage of its immediate impact on the public.  \n&bull; As the storyline evolves, it is important to continue to make basic, background, and contextual information available. New audience members will begin consuming your coverage during different times; make sure the story always makes sense to audiences seeing the coverage for the first time.  \n",
