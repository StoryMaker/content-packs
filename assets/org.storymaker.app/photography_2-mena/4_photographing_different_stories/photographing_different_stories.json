Ask yourself what visual element of the event best symbolizes the overall story; that is likely your photograph.

The photographer should try to illustrate the key dramatic and narrative elements of the event. Think foreground (subject) and background (context). Often coverage is after the event has happened. Reaction shots \u2014 how people are responding to the event or its aftermath \u2014 can make very powerful images.
