Some are quick, unplanned and done at the scene.

It is ethically and professionally very important to do this, though there are some exceptions. (For more on this see section 8 on professional standards and ethics).  \nLet the subject know if you or another journalist will be using a camera to record photos or video \u2014 the subject should not be caught surprised or unprepared. In some places, explicit permission is needed to record audio or video. Know the laws where you are reporting. If permission is needed, ask the source first before recording, then ask again after recording so you have a record of it.  \n### Start with basic questions  \nDepending on the amount of time you have, it is important to start with basic, safe questions. Help people get comfortable before you begin asking more emotionally difficult or challenging questions. It may help to give people some information about yourself.  \n### Control the interview  \nSometimes people have expectations for your interview that are different than your own. Politicians frequently try to turn an interview to subjects important to them. Private citizens unfamiliar with the interview process often talk about things irrelevant to the topic. You need to be polite but firm in controlling the interview. Monologues are never as informative as interviews consisting of questions and short, relevant answers.  \n### Do not rush the answer  \nWhile it is important to control the pace of the interview, it is important to let people complete a thought. People will sometimes try to fill an awkward silence by saying more \u2014 sometimes more than they should!  \n### Probe and clarify  \nSometimes sources are not good at answering questions clearly. Other times they are intentionally trying to avoid answering a question. In either case, you can ask your question a different way. Sometimes it helps to restate the answer to the source: \u201cso, you are saying that\u2026\u201d as a way to confirm an answer. With politicians it may help to ask a more general version of a question if they refuse to answer it specifically.  \n",
