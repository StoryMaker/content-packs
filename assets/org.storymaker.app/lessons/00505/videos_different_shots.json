Each shot type has specific goals it is best suited to achieve. You may be able to explain your location with other shot types, but the wide shot is the easiest option to do it successfully. For example, wide shots are filmed far away from a subject. This distance often provides a clear image of the area around the subject, which is why it is effective to depict the location.  \n",

These clip types are:  \nPlace:  A place clip is framed as a long, wide or detail shot, and intends to establish where the story happens.  \nCharacter: A character clip is framed as a close up or medium shot. It is a specific response from a character to a question, or a character saying something about himself.  \nAction: An action clip is framed as a long, medium or detail shot, it must clearly depict an action being done.  \nResult: A result clip is similar to an action, but closer, to depict the results. This should be framed as a detail or medium shot.  \nSignature: A signature is most often framed as a detail shot. Signature clips are meant to emphasize a key point of your story.  \n",
