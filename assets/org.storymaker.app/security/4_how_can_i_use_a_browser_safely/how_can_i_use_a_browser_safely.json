This gateway can open or close to control Internet access to and from the given country.

For instance, it could record your country of residence in order to present a relevant country page when visiting a particular website.

Most sites on the web can be accessed using the unencrypted HTTP protocol. HTTP is vulnerable to eavesdropping, and even to intermediaries that might modify the pages a browser is fetching.  \nHTTPS is a more secure alternative to HTTP. HTTPS encrypts pages and attempts to ensure three things: 1) that third parties cannot see the contents of the page, 2) that the page cannot be modified by third parties, and 3) that the page was really sent by the web server listed in the URL bar.  \nUnfortunately, a web server must be configured to support HTTPS properly before you can use it. If there is a site you were planning to send sensitive information to, ensure that you are using HTTPS. If a site does not support HTTPS, do not send sensitive information to it.  \n",

They enable you to browse with a level of privacy and anonymity that HTTPS alone does not provide.  \nImagine you send a letter to a friend and package it in several envelopes, writing a different address on each. The letter will circulate around these addresses in a secret order. None of the receivers will know its origin or final destination, but only the previous address it came from and the next one it will go to.  \nThe TOR network is a similar system. It will anonymize your online presence and browsing requests. Surveillance agents at your ISP or a national gateway will not know the final destination of your browsing query, and the website you visit will not know where your request came from.  \nTOR can now be implemented via mobile on Android-based devices. Orbot and Orweb are two apps that work together to provide an anonymous browsing experience.  \n",
