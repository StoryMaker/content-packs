If you or your source may be threatened, you should send only encrypted SMS; send them minimally and only between anonymous phones.  \nTo send encrypted SMS, you must use a specific app. Both you and your source must use the same app. Send your source a message via your app of choice in order to initiate a key exchange. Once you\u2019ve exchanged keys, you may communicate with your source via encrypted texts.  \n",
