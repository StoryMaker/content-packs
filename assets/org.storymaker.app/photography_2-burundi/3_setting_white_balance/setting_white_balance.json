You will recognize fleshtones even if the light illuminating the subject is a greenish-blue fluorescent.  \nA digital camera can\u2019t do that. It has to be calibrated to adjust for different light sources\u2019 color temperature. This calibration is measured against absolute white. That\u2019s why it is called white balance.  \n",
