Because there is no image, you must help the audience visualize the story through your use of sounds. Clear and interesting sound can paint a good picture in the mind of anyone who listens. The trick is to present those sounds in the best possible way to create a compelling mental picture.  \n",

Test the level before you record; make sure it is neither too loud nor too quiet, and that sharp or sudden sounds, such as turning a page suddenly, or car horns outside, won\u2019t make the content you want to record inaudible. Once you begin recording, be sure to wait a few seconds before speaking, and do the same before you hit the button to stop recording; give it a few extra seconds of silence.  \n \n",
