Symbols often mean different things to different people, particularly for people from different societies or cultures. To make your stories powerful, you should include visual symbols. Audiences understand them emotionally and quickly. Symbols alone can tell great stories.  \n",

For example, in the first days after the 2011 revolution in Libya, graffiti covered the walls of the nation\u2019s largest cities. At first this graffiti stood as a symbol of hope, of the desires of Libya\u2019s new generation. That same graffiti now stands as a symbol of the lost hope and foolish dreams of Libya\u2019s people.  \n",

The village hides him, but is threatened with destruction if he does not come out. Before he gives up, he symbolizes selfishness; he is willing to let the whole village suffer just for him. When he gives up and saves the village, he symbolizes bravery and generosity.  \n&bull; In a presidential race, a politician considers running against his brother. When the politician speaks in favor of his brother, he symbolizes loyalty. When he declares his own candidacy against his brother, he symbolizes betrayal.  \n&bull; A football player who scores the cup-winning goal symbolizes a hero. When he is exposed as a an abusive husband, he is seen as a coward.  \n",
