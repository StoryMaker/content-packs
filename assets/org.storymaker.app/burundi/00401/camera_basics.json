Your eye can see details in places with extreme contrast \u2014 highlights on a snow-covered mountain top, for example, and dark shadows in a cave entrance in the side of that same mountain. Digital cameras cannot always see details visible to your eyes. Images often appear too bright or too dark.  \nYour eye is quick to focus on the singular thing of interest in your field of view. A digital camera must be told where to focus, especially in low light, and can be slow to focus.  \n",

This is called the shutter speed. In photography this is measured in fractions of a second. The shutter allows photographers to freeze action. If the shutter is too slow, the subject\u2019s movement may be recorded by the sensor, making it appear blurry. You may not have the full range of shutter functionality on your mobile device.  \nMost mobile devices will not let you directly control the shutter. But many Android camera and camera apps will offer a preset for action photos that works by favoring a faster shutter speed in the exposure calculation.  \n",
