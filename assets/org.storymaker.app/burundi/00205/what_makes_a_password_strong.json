(Hamlet, Shakespeare)\nWe can convert this to: 2Bon2B?TItQ  \nIn the previous example, we have substituted words with similar-sounding numbers and acronyms, with nouns and verbs capitalized and other words appearing in lowercase letters.  \nOr, for instance: I had a dream, where all men were born equal (Martin Luther King)  \nWe can convert this to: 1haDwaMwB=\n",
