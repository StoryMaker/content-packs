Because such reports are about something that may still be going on, sometimes there will be unanswered questions that will be addressed in follow-up reports. Breaking news stories may feature a reporter at the location of the action, with his/her voice explaining what is known so far and what can be seen on the ground from that vantage point. In some cases, a breaking news story may be introduced from a remote location based on secondhand reports when it is not possible to be there. It is crucial that you at least cover the following questions: Who, What, Where, Why, When, and How.  \n",
