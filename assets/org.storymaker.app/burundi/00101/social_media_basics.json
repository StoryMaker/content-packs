Remember: Pseudonymity is not the same thing as anonymity. (See the security section for more on this.)  \n&bull; Be informed on the issues you cover. Become an expert. This will help you provide better content and stay ahead of the pack.  \n&bull; Be as neutral as possible in the tone of your coverage, no matter how dramatic the event or how passionately you feel about it.  \n&bull; In discussions with editors, be transparent about your coverage techniques and any potential conflicts of interest you may have.  \n&bull; Attribute information in your report to specific sources, and provide contact information for sources when possible so reporting can be verified. (More on this in the reporting section of this section.)  \n&bull; Smart text in the form of captions, keywords, tags, titles, and stories is essential even for video, photo, and audio stories. Search engines and the editors who use them will not be able to find your story without good search terms associated with your story. Furthermore, once editors find your story, the text will help them understand and verify your reporting. (More on this in the next section).  \n&bull; No matter the tool, the presentation should be technically professional. Shaky and out-of-focus video with lots of zooms and pans is an example of content that is not technically professional. (More on this in the video section.)  \n&bull; Try to understand what sort of story you are doing and how it fits into broader coverage of the issue. Different kinds of stories are structured in unique ways. For example, a breaking story about a bombing will take a different form \u2014 require a different style of presentation and even different information \u2014 than a profile about an injured rebel fighter and his feelings about an upcoming election. In addition, large news organizations often combine several stories of different types to create a \u201cpackage.\u201d Understand how your story will fit into this broader coverage. (More on this in the section on story types.)  \n&bull; Do not present what you do not know or cannot verify. A more limited but completely accurate story is more valuable than one that is far-reaching but based on conjecture.  \n&bull; It is important to become part of groups, boards and other discussion related to your issues or regions of coverage.  \n",
