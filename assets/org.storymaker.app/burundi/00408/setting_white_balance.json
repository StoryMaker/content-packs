You will recognize fleshtones even if the light illuminating the subject is a greenish-blue fluorescent.  \nA digital camera can\u2019t do that. It has to be calibrated to adjust for different light sources\u2019 color temperature. This calibration is measured against absolute white. That\u2019s why it is called white balance.  \n",

Your smartphone may have a button or menu option for white balance. It will offer several icons representing five or six common light sources. Pick the one that best represents the shooting conditions you are working under.  \nIf your smartphone cannot control white balance manually, you can correct color with post-production apps (for more on this, see the section on post-production).
