This may be as simple as adding a \u201cdarken\u201d filter for overexposed images or an \u201cindoor\u201d filter for images that are very yellow.

These include cropping, dodging and burning, conversion into grayscale, and normal toning and color adjustments that should be limited to those minimally necessary for clear and accurate reproduction (analogous to the burning and dodging often used in darkroom processing of images) and that restore the authentic nature of the photograph.  \n&bull; Changes in density, contrast, color, and saturation levels that substantially alter the original scene are not acceptable.  \n&bull; Backgrounds should not be digitally blurred or eliminated by burning down or aggressive toning.  \n",
