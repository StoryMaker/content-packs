If it is an event, you will want to plan what sounds you will use from the event, how you can record it or, if it already exists, how you can get it. Just like introducing a guest or an interviewee, you can also introduce a piece of audio that illustrates the story. Audio can be misleading, so it is useful to have a voice that explains what is being heard, when it took place, and where. You can choose how to do that explanation when planning your story; perhaps you want to first let the audience hear the sounds of a protest or a celebration and then explain what they just heard. Or you can explain what they are about to hear, and then play the audio.  \n",
