Every blog entry records the IP address (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) of the computer it was sent from, and many ISPs (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISP) record all traffic that has passed through them. Therefore, if you are publishing sensitive information on a website, you must take precautions to not be found out. We discussed disguising your browsing in Lesson X.X. with Tor. If you must maintain anonymity online, be sure to use the Tor anonymity network to access your site and publish your content.  \n",

This can be linked to you, especially if your Internet caf\u00e9 owner writes down your name and the time of your visit. To overcome this difficulty, ask a colleague from another country to post the blog for you. Use a secure webmail service (or encryption) to send the article to your colleague and ask him/her to wait for a while before publishing it on your blog.  \nYour identity can be determined not only by the name you choose for yourself or your source. Your identity can also be determined by the trail you leave through your online activity.  \n",
