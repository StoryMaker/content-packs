Many smartphones provide a variety of presets for white balance.  \n!(5.png)  \n## Sample icons for the common white balance options  \nIf your mobile device allows you to set the white balance manually, do it. Your smartphone may have a button or menu option for white balance. It will offer several icons representing five or six common light sources. Pick the one that best represents the shooting conditions you are working under.  \nIf your smartphone cannot control white balance manually, you can correct color with post-production apps (for more on this, see the section on post-production). If the color temperature is way off, it is VERY IMPORTANT to make adjustments before publishing your images.  \n",
