Some issue and event stories do not lend themselves to photo, video, or audio. These can be policy stories, visually uninteresting press conferences, or stories that are challenging because of lighting, noise, or access, or they are reported after the fact. If text is going to play a lead role in your presentation, it should have the following news-dispatch-like characteristics:  \n&bull; Sentences should be short: 25-35 words. Use simple, declarative sentences.  \n&bull; Get to the point quickly. The basic facts of the story should be in the first sentence or two. Draw your reader into the story with important information up top. Do not save the best for last.  \n&bull; Think factoids (see the reporting lesson). Provide essential, basic information: who, what, where, when, and why.  \n&bull; One post, one idea: Limit each post to a single point. There is nothing to prevent you from multiple posts, each about a different element of the larger story.  \n&bull; Avoid inflammatory or biased language.  \n&bull; Include relevant links and hashtags when possible.  \n&bull; Think follow up: How can you use your text posts to build an audience for additional coverage of the topic throughout the story cycle?  \n",

  "using_text::markdown_card_4::text": "## Writing keywords and tags\nAudiences outside of your social network and search engines interested in the topics you cover need to be able to find your stories. There is no way to search directly for a picture, video, or audio file. People can only search for text, so the keywords and tags associated with your media content is important. Keywords and tags should identify your story and relate it to broader topical themes of interest to your audience.  \nKeywords and tags can be written into the keyword or tags fields either in StoryMaker or on the platform on which the story will be published. In addition to the fields, keywords and tags can be included in a photo caption or a text post.  \n### Guidelines for keyword and tag writing  \n&bull; Use between 5 and 10 keywords or tags.  \n&bull; Spell words out completely.  \n&bull; Order the keywords or tags in terms of importance or likely search choice.  \n&bull; Select clear, common descriptors. For example, use  \u201cenvironmental\u201d rather than \u201cgreen.\u201d  \n&bull; Include broad descriptors for specific names used in the caption. For example, if \u201cthe Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Medicine\u201d appears in the caption, use \u201cchildren\u201d and \u201chospital\u201d as keywords or tags.  \n&bull; Include alternative descriptors to those that appear in the caption.  \n&bull; Include geographic location.  \n&bull; Include important proper names.  \n",
