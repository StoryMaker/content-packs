  "captions_and_keywords::markdown_card_4::text": "## Captions in Photo Essays  \nThe captions for a photo essay should not repeat the same information over and over. Write captions as short, progressive explanations of the individual image in the context of the entire slideshow. In some cases you may present them as title cards that present short factoids. Factoids are additional information or statistics that help provide context.  \n",

For example, with computer security: hacking, hackers, security, firewall, attack, network, flaw.  \n&bull; The order of the keywords/tags is important; the first couple of words are valued more heavily.  \n",
