They take an overall reading of light coming into the lens and average it to set the exposure. The camera will have difficulty estimating exposure if there is a lot of variation in the available light \u2014 mobile cameras cannot expose well for images with a lot of variation between highlights and shadows.  \nInsufficient light is the most common problem photographers confront. A camera is a poor light-gathering device compared to the human eye. One of the biggest challenges photographers have when shooting in low light is recognizing the problem and methodically solving it rather than taking a bunch of images and hoping one will work out.  \n",

This can help compensate for excessive highlights or shadow areas in the frame.  \nImages that are slightly overexposed or underexposed can sometimes be fixed in post-production with built-in photo software apps or apps such as Adobe Photoshop Express. Adobe Photoshop Express allows you to manage exposure in your picture. You can touch the face of a person in your photo and the camera will reset exposure for his/her face.  \n",
