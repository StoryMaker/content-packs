They speak to the universal human experience, the fundamental challenges we all face in life. And they do it in a way that audiences can relate to. It might be about lost love, a moral dilemma, economic struggle, triumph toward a dream, or confronting death. This is what the story is really about and is what gives a story impact. Every good story is built on something deeper than the immediate climax.  \n",

  "deeper_meaning::markdown_card_4::text": "Here are some examples of deeper meaning in a variety of stories:  \n&bull; In a war, soldiers are hunting a man. They threaten to burn the whole village if he does not give himself up. Central question: Will the man give himself up?

Another deeper meaning here is: Sometimes the few are sacrificed to save the many.  \n&bull; In a presidential race, a politician is considering running against his brother. Central question: Will he challenge his brother? Climax: Yes, he enters the race. Deeper meaning: Sometimes ambition is stronger than loyalty.  \n&bull; In a local measles outbreak. Central question: will the disease spread outside the community? Climax: Parents keep all infected children in the community at home until they are all no longer infectious. Deeper meaning: Sometimes we need to act together to solve problems.  \n",

Stories and programs without a deeper meaning have little impact on the audience; they don\u2019t prompt discussion and won\u2019t be remembered.  \n",
