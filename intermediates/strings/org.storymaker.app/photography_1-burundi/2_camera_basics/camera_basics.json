It has a digital sensor that collects light, a shutter button that controls how long the sensor is exposed to light, and a lens to control the amount of light that strikes the sensor. Here is a brief explanation of each.  \n",

  "camera_basics::markdown_card_6::text": "## The shutter\nWhen you push the shutter button, the camera activates the sensor. This controls the length of time that light is absorbed by the sensor. This is called the shutter speed. In photography this is measured in fractions of a second. The shutter allows photographers to freeze action. If the shutter is too slow, the subject\u2019s movement may be recorded by the sensor, making it appear blurry. You may not have the full range of shutter functionality on your mobile device.  \nMost mobile devices will not let you directly control the shutter. But many Android camera and camera apps will offer a preset for action photos that works by favoring a faster shutter speed in the exposure calculation.  \n",

  "camera_basics::markdown_card_5::text": "![ISO usage for different environments](7.png)  \nDigital sensors can be set at different record levels, increasing or decreasing their sensitivity to light. This system for adjusting the sensor\u2019s sensitivity is called the ISO and is measured in numeric range, typically from 100 to 800 and higher on mobile device. Your ISO should be higher in low light (800) and lower in bright light (100). Your camera will set the ISO automatically. But many Android devices and camera apps will let you set it manually.  \n",

More expensive cameras provide the photographer more manual control over these features, but even smartphones now let you adjust exposure by changing the ISO or touching the screen at a point that represents a medium exposure value. Some also have digital zoom that allow you to zoom in or out.  \n",

Your eye can see details in places with extreme contrast \u2014 highlights on a snow-covered mountain top, for example, and dark shadows in a cave entrance in the side of that same mountain. Digital cameras cannot always see details visible to your eyes. Images often appear too bright or too dark.  \nYour eye is quick to focus on the singular thing of interest in your field of view. A digital camera must be told where to focus, especially in low light, and can be slow to focus.  \n",
