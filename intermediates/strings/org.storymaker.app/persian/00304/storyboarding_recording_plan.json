  "storyboarding_recording_plan::markdown_card_9::text": "When outlining how your story will be told, besides considering what voices you want to hear from, consider what sound will help the audience visualize the story. You will probably need background sounds to add color to the story, some voice-over, and introductions. If it is an event, you will want to plan what sounds you will use from the event, how you can record it or, if it already exists, how you can get it. Just like introducing a guest or an interviewee, you can also introduce a piece of audio that illustrates the story. Audio can be misleading, so it is useful to have a voice that explains what is being heard, when it took place, and where. You can choose how to do that explanation when planning your story; perhaps you want to first let the audience hear the sounds of a protest or a celebration and then explain what they just heard. Or you can explain what they are about to hear, and then play the audio.  \n",

  "storyboarding_recording_plan::markdown_card_7::text": "## Personal introduction  \nBefore you conduct an audio interview that will be part of your story, always have questions prepared. These questions not only enable you to plan your interview, they also act as guidelines when you forget what you want to ask or you find a previous question is not going well and you want to move on. Look over those questions and ask yourself if they are structured in a way that can lead to detailed and interesting answers instead of yes, no, or one-word answers that are rarely interesting for an audio audience.  \n",
