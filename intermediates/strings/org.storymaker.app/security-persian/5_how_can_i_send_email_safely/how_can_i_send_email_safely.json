If you live in a country with strong legal protection of privacy, the legislation will not apply when your email reaches the ISP of the recipient in a country with different privacy laws. While your email is in transit from country A to country B, it could pass the routers of several other countries.  \n",

Reset the browser before and after each use (be certain to erase browsing history and remove cookies) You can also use a \u201cprivate browsing\u201d or \u201cincognito\u201d mode, which will not collect cookies and delete browsing history upon closing.  \nFor added security, connect from a different IP address when doing things anonymously. For example, use your regular accounts when at home but use your anonymous accounts only when using wireless at a cafe. Remember using the same cafe repeatedly also reduces the chance of anonymity.  \nThe only way to send email that is truly private and secure is with an encrypted email provider or an email client that enables device-side encryption. Use a device-side encryption if at all possible, and use an encryption option such as PGP that provides an open standard to ensure the encryption does what it claims.  \n",
