  "central_question::markdown_card_3::text": "Early on, the story must establish a question the audience expects the story will answer. You must always be aware of your central question when reporting and editing your story. The central question is often about emotional outcome rather than about information and facts. Frame your story around the central question, not only around answering \u201cwho, what, where, when, why, and how,\u201d the informational elements also known as the Five Ws and H. Facts are a necessary part of news stories, but the facts should be told through story. Asking \u201cWhat will happen next?\u201d builds story. The story directs the delivery of the facts, not the other way around. A clear initial central question is the starting point that launches a great story.  \n",

Sometimes it is hard to know the central question of your story when your coverage begins, or the question may change as your story evolves. You need to be aware of these uncertainties or shifts and adjust your reporting or presentation to make sure there is a central question and an answer.  \n",

If this is the central question, you should frame the story with that question always in mind.  \n&bull; In a news story about trouble in a celebrity marriage, the central question might be: \u201cWill they stay together or get divorced?\u201d This central question helps frame the story to look to the future and encourages the audience to keep asking, \u201cWhat happens next?\u201d  \n&bull; The central question for a breaking news story about a traffic accident might be: \u201cHow many were injured?\u201d \u201cWill the injured survive?\u201d Or if the person who caused the accident fled, the question might be: \u201cWill the responsible driver be caught?\u201d All of these are strong central questions that help direct and guide the story.  \n",
