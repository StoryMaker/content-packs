  "audio_basics::markdown_card_1::text": "![Planning an audio story](2.png)  \nRecording audio is not as complicated as shooting video or photos, but it requires basic technical knowledge combined with a good plan to tell a story using only sound. Because there is no image, you must help the audience visualize the story through your use of sounds. Clear and interesting sound can paint a good picture in the mind of anyone who listens. The trick is to present those sounds in the best possible way to create a compelling mental picture.  \n", 
  "audio_basics::markdown_card_2::text": "## Recording techniques  \nWhether you are recording voices or capturing ambient sounds to use in your story, ensure you are recording sound that can be heard clearly. You don\u2019t want to think that you\u2019ve recorded something usable for your story and learn you missed a piece, didn\u2019t record anything, or your levels were so bad the recording is not understandable. Test the level before you record; make sure it is neither too loud nor too quiet, and that sharp or sudden sounds, such as turning a page suddenly, or car horns outside, won\u2019t make the content you want to record inaudible. Once you begin recording, be sure to wait a few seconds before speaking, and do the same before you hit the button to stop recording; give it a few extra seconds of silence.  \n \n",

When your question is answered, record a few seconds of silence at the end before stopping.  \n&bull; Using headphones, check your audio levels  with a short recording before you start recording clips to use in your story.  \n&bull; Use multiple sources of audio to tell your story.  \n&bull;   Find different sounds and quotes that will help tell your story. Try to use your own voice as little as possible and tell the story through the voices of others.  \n",

You can paint that picture using many sources of audio, including people\u2019s voices, the sounds of an event, your own (dynamic and emotional) voice explaining or narrating a story, and ambient sounds that set the scene, such as men working, protesters chanting, the sounds of a kitchen. Any given story can have multiple sources of audio that when used together will tell a great story that listeners will be able to see and feel.  \n",
