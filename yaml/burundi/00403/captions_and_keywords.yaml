                ## Example Photo with a good caption, keywords, and tags.  
                ![Example photo.](2.jpg)  
                ### Caption: 4 December, 2014 — Bujumbura — Student sitting at a computer in the central library of Lake Tanganyika University, the most well-known university of Burundi. Doing meaninful research was always near-impossible in this underfunded university, but internet access is helping to change that.
                ### Keywords: Lake Tanganyika University, Internet access, Library, Research, Poverty, Higher Education, Burundi, Bujumbura  
                ### Tags: Girl, Computer, Books, Library, Chair, Table, Bujumbura, Africa, School, University  
                Every photograph needs a caption and keywords/tags. A good caption provides the audience basic information and context to understand a photograph and its relevance to the news: where the photo was taken, when it was taken, and a very brief description of what’s in the photo. Search engines and search fields on sites like Flickr can’t recognize images. They can only recognize text associated with the image. Keywords and tags, along with the caption, help viewers find images through search engines.

                Captions should be clear, accurate and complete in the information they provide about the photograph.

                ## Captions in Photo Essays  
                The captions for a photo essay should not repeat the same information over and over. Write captions as short, progressive explanations of the individual image in the context of the entire slideshow. In some cases you may present them as title cards that present short factoids. Factoids are additional information or statistics that help provide context.

                ## Writing captions  
                A caption should be one or two sentences. In most photo captions the first sentence identifies the people and location of the photograph and date when it was taken. The second sentence should provide contextual information to help the audience understand what they are looking at.  
                  
                The first sentence should:  
                &bull; Be written in the present tense.  
                &bull; Be written as a complete sentence.  
                &bull; Describe what is in the picture.  
                &bull; Say exactly when it was taken.  
                &bull; Say exactly where it was taken.  
                  
                A second or sometimes third sentence:  
                &bull; Typically can be written in the past tense if that makes more sense.  
                &bull; Should be written as a complete sentence.  
                &bull; Should provide context to allow the audience to better understand the significance of the image.

                A child severely burned by a car bomb on June 9, 2010, receives care at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Medicine in Kabul, Afghanistan. Doctors are struggling with limited medicines to treat the growing number of child victims whose injuries are often compounded by other medical problems, such as poor nutrition, that diminish a child’s ability to heal.

                The exact format for captions can vary, but a basic photo caption should:
                &bull; Clearly identify the people and location in the photo. Professional titles and the formal name of the location should be included. In large groups, identifications of only notable people may be required. At public events where individuals in the frame are not significant no I.D. may be required.  
                &bull; Include the date the photograph was taken. If an archive photograph or photograph taken prior to the event is used, the caption should make it clear that it is a “file photo.”  
                &bull; Provide some context or background for the audience members so they can understand the news value of the photograph.

                ![Tags: Car Rental, Economy, Bujumbura, Burundi, NGOs, War, Crisis](10.jpg)  
                ### Tags: Car Rental, Economy, Bujumbura, Burundi, NGOs, War, Crisis 
                Keywords and tags help search engines find images and work to identify photos in the archive. Typically there will be a field for keywords or tags along with the caption field.

                ## Tips for writing keywords and tags:
                &bull; Include specific geographic information.
                &bull; Avoid abbreviations.  
                &bull; Keyword with the kind of photo it is (portrait, demonstration, economy).  
                &bull; Consider word choice: Would someone use another word more naturally to do a search?  
                &bull; Think about related words to your topic that might help direct people to your photo.  
                &bull; Use common words that reflect specific subjects. For example, with computer security: hacking, hackers, security, firewall, attack, network, flaw.  
                &bull; The order of the keywords/tags is important; the first couple of words are valued more heavily.

                ## THINGS TO REMEMBER  
                &bull; Basic caption and keywords should always be included.  
                &bull; Make sure names of people and places are correctly identified and spelled.  
                &bull; Be accurate.  
                &bull; Photojournalism is journalism.  
                &bull; If a photo is manipulated digitally beyond simple sizing and color control, it should be labeled as a “photo illustration” in the caption or in the photo credit. If unusual photo techniques are used, such as high dynamic range (HDR) effects, it should be noted in the caption.  
                &bull; Do not editorialize or make assumptions about what someone in a picture is thinking or feeling, for example: “an unhappy voter” or “a fortunate survivor.”
