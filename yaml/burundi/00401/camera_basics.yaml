                A big part of understanding how a camera works and how to use it is to understand what it does not do well compared to the human eye. Your eye can see details in places with extreme contrast — highlights on a snow-covered mountain top, for example, and dark shadows in a cave entrance in the side of that same mountain. Digital cameras cannot always see details visible to your eyes. Images often appear too bright or too dark.  
                Your eye is quick to focus on the singular thing of interest in your field of view. A digital camera must be told where to focus, especially in low light, and can be slow to focus.

                ## How a camera works  
                A digital camera is very simple. It has a digital sensor that collects light, a shutter button that controls how long the sensor is exposed to light, and a lens to control the amount of light that strikes the sensor. Here is a brief explanation of each.

                ## The sensor  
                How a camera sensor accepts light:  
                  
                A. Incoming light  
                B. Color filters  
                C. Light is converted to electricity  
                D. Sensor is made up of millions of pixels that collect light.  
                  
                Inside every digital camera is a sensor that records light. These sensors come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and designs. Larger sensors are better at recording good color and sharp images, especially in low light.

                ![ISO usage for different environments](7.png)  
                Digital sensors can be set at different record levels, increasing or decreasing their sensitivity to light. This system for adjusting the sensor’s sensitivity is called the ISO and is measured in numeric range, typically from 100 to 800 and higher on mobile device. Your ISO should be higher in low light (800) and lower in bright light (100). Your camera will set the ISO automatically. But many Android devices and camera apps will let you set it manually.

                ## The shutter
                When you push the shutter button, the camera activates the sensor. This controls the length of time that light is absorbed by the sensor. This is called the shutter speed. In photography this is measured in fractions of a second. The shutter allows photographers to freeze action. If the shutter is too slow, the subject’s movement may be recorded by the sensor, making it appear blurry. You may not have the full range of shutter functionality on your mobile device.  
                Most mobile devices will not let you directly control the shutter. But many Android camera and camera apps will offer a preset for action photos that works by favoring a faster shutter speed in the exposure calculation.

                ![How a camera aperture works](8.png)  
                ## Aperture  
                The aperture is a small valve or iris that controls the amount of light that striking the lens of the camera. The larger the valve opening, the more light that will strike the sensor. The smaller the iris valve, the less light striking the sensor.

                ## Balancing the exposure triangle

                Example of a balanced photo.  
                Creating an image with a proper exposure is very much a game of playing ISO, aperture, and shutter off of one another to achieve the desired effect. More expensive cameras provide the photographer more manual control over these features, but even smartphones now let you adjust exposure by changing the ISO or touching the screen at a point that represents a medium exposure value. Some also have digital zoom that allow you to zoom in or out.

                ## Working within limitations  
                Understanding these limitations and working within them is the key to getting the most out of your smartphone camera. Remember, if you have a smartphone and you need photos for your story, plan your coverage around time of day or lighting conditions if possible.

                Additionally, while the image of ambulances speeding by might be a great one for your story, you may opt to also take a more static picture of the front of the hospital to make sure you have a usable image in case the ambulance photo doesn’t work out.

                ## THINGS TO REMEMBER  
                &bull; Smartphone cameras is that phone cameras are limited in what they can do compared to larger point-and-shoots and certainly dSLRs.  
                &bull; You do not have the same degree of manual control with a smart phone camera as you do with a point-and-shoot or dSLR.  
                &bull; Smartphone cameras are difficult to use in low light.  
                &bull; Smartphone cameras sometimes struggle with fast movement.
