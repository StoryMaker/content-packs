              ## Creating a detailed, complete story often requires more than three clips. In addition to using multiple character, action and result clips, many stories include two more elements:  
              
              &bull; Place  
              
              If your character will be in many places, use place clips to show the change.  
              
              &bull; Signature  
              
              You may want to show a specific, signature element of your character or story. Signature clips are meant to emphasize a key point of your story.
