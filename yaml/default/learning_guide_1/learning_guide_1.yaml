              ## The most simple story has three elements:  
              
              &bull; Character  
              &bull; Action done by the character  
              &bull; Result of the action  
              
              You can combine these elements to tell a simple story. A story needs a main character who must take an action, and at the end audience wants to see the result of that action.
