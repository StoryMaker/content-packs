                &bull; How to adjust color with white balance control.

                Your eyes, in combination with your brain, do an excellent job of calibrating how you perceive color. You will recognize a color as red even if the light source illuminating it is very yellow, making the apparent color orange. You will recognize fleshtones even if the light illuminating the subject is a greenish-blue fluorescent.  
                A digital camera can’t do that. It has to be calibrated to adjust for different light sources’ color temperature. This calibration is measured against absolute white. That’s why it is called white balance.

                ### An example of a subject lit by a tungsten bulb  
                Tungsten bulbs have a very warm light temperature, coloring images more yellow.

                ### An example of a subject outside on a cloudy day
                Daylight on an overcast, cloudy day has a very cool light temperature, coloring the image blue.

                Other light sources — sunlight, fluorescent light, shade — all fall in the middle. Color temperature has nothing to do with the amount of light.

                Good color management is important. It makes an image much more professional in appearance. Many smartphones provide a variety of presets for white balance.

                ## Sample icons for the common white balance options  
                If your mobile device allows you to set the white balance manually, do it. Your smartphone may have a button or menu option for white balance. It will offer several icons representing five or six common light sources. Pick the one that best represents the shooting conditions you are working under.  
                If your smartphone cannot control white balance manually, you can correct color with post-production apps (for more on this, see the section on post-production). If the color temperature is way off, it is VERY IMPORTANT to make adjustments before publishing your images.

                ## AWB (auto white balance)  
                Use this setting for shooting anywhere. The mobile device does its best to guess what the right setting should be, but it can provide poor results if the camera guesses wrong. This is the setting you should use if you’re unsure of which setting is the best choice.

                ## Daylight  
                Use this setting for shooting outdoors. This setting will give your images a very “cool” or slight blue tint. When shooting indoors, this setting will give your images an orange tint.

                ## Cloudy  
                Use this setting for shooting outdoors. This setting will give your images a slightly “warmer” color. While the daylight option is technically the more correct white balance, using the cloudy setting creates a very appealing image. When shooting indoors, this setting will give your images a strong orange tint.

                ## Incandescent  
                Use this setting for shooting indoors, where the room is lit with traditional small light bulbs. When shooting outdoors, this setting will give your images a strong blue tint.

                ## Fluorescent  
                Use this setting when shooting indoors, where the room is lit with long, tube fluorescent lights. When shooting outdoors, this setting will give your images a blue tint.

                ## THINGS TO REMEMBER  
                &bull; You must manage white balance for good results.  
                &bull; Adjust your white balance if you move from one light type to another while shooting.  
                &bull; It is best to use a manual white-balance setting, but auto white balance is OK.
