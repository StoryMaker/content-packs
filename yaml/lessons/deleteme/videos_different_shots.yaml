                A successful shot is more than well-composed. A good shot provides specific information that progresses the story. Each shot type has specific goals it is best suited to achieve. You may be able to explain your location with other shot types, but the wide shot is the easiest option to do it successfully. For example, wide shots are filmed far away from a subject. This distance often provides a clear image of the area around the subject, which is why it is effective to depict the location.

                Each type of shot has a goal that also answers a specific question about the story.

                By shooting a complete set of shot types, you can allow yourself to focus on a separate part of the story with each shot, and as a group they will tell a complete story.

                Wide shots show the location or scene where the story takes place. Wide shots are typically used once in a scene, usually at the beginning.  
                If you use wide shots multiple times, you should be showing a dramatic change to the location. For example, an empty town square to a full town square is a successful use of two location shots. Additionally you may use new wide shots to indicate a change in the location.

                Long shots show how the characters interact with the location. They show the character engaged in an action, or the result of the action.  
                Long shots are best used to highlight a character’s actions, and can be effective for including multiple characters.

                Medium shots help the audience focus entirely on one or two characters, and may not provide an understanding of the location.  
                Medium shots are good at showing the character’s body language. Proper head space and a strong eye line are important to using medium shots effectively.

                Close up Shots force the audience to focus entirely on a single character, and emphasize the emotion of the character.  
                Do not worry about incorporating the environment in close up shots. Pay close attention to the eyes of your subject, and focus on capturing emotion.

                Detail shots demonstrate an interesting detail, often focusing entirely on an important action or object.  
                Detail shots are best used to highlight details lost in wider shots. Frame detail shots for the specific details you want; cut out everything else. A subject’s hands are usually good to start with, especially when performing an action. This shot is best used to highlight details lost in wider shots.

                ## StoryMaker Shots and Clips  
                StoryMaker takes the standard video concept of shot types, and treats them slightly differently. StoryMaker divides the shots based on how they are used in the story, and some clips may use multiple types of shot. These clip types are:  
                Place:  A place clip is framed as a long, wide or detail shot, and intends to establish where the story happens.  
                Character: A character clip is framed as a close up or medium shot. It is a specific response from a character to a question, or a character saying something about himself.  
                Action: An action clip is framed as a long, medium or detail shot, it must clearly depict an action being done.  
                Result: A result clip is similar to an action, but closer, to depict the results. This should be framed as a detail or medium shot.  
                Signature: A signature is most often framed as a detail shot. Signature clips are meant to emphasize a key point of your story.

                ## THINGS TO REMEMBER  
                &bull; Sometimes you will see a big-budget movie that has shaky camera work, and sometimes you will see a documentary with intricate and complex camera work.  
                &bull; The rules of visual storytelling apply to every genre, regardless of where it is screened or how many people it took to produce it.
