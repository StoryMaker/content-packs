                Recording audio is easy, but there are many ways to ruin the recording so that it is unusable. To ensure this does not happen, practice these simple steps while you are recording an interview, supporting audio, or recording yourself narrating a story. Following these steps may prevent an audio problem before it happens. Once your audio is recorded badly, it is extremely difficult to save it.

                When preparing to record, hold your device in a way that is comfortable and natural. Hold the device without applying much pressure, in a manner that you can hold for an extended period of time. Otherwise, you may hear “handling noise” in your audio, this happens when you move the mic while recording, and your hand or something else rubs across the microphone.  
                ![Resting your elbow](1.png)  
                If you must hold the recording device up to the person throughout the interview, rest your elbow on a solid surface. It is best to sit down, rest your elbow on the table and extend your arm toward the audio source.

                Hold the microphone a bit under the mouth of the interviewee so that the airstream coming out of his or her mouth will not create hissing or popping sounds in the recording.  
                If there is a table between you and the person you are interviewing, you can set the recorder on a table, but take care no one touches, taps, or bangs the table, as this may cause contact noise.

                ![Example of mic stands](5.png)  
                There are several types of stands that fit handheld recorders or smart phones to hold them in place during the interview. You can make your own using materials you have. Anything you can rest the recorder on that keeps it at face level with your audio source will do.

                Detecting air conditioning sounds and other machine sounds that can ruin your audio recording should be done before you begin recording. When you arrive at the location, take notice of any and all sounds, even those that seem harmless. Ask if machines causing noise can be turned off, or suggest a change of location for the sake of the audio quality. Most people will understand and trust your expertise on the subject.

                ## THINGS TO REMEMBER  
                &bull; Always consider how long you will have to hold your recorder steady before you begin an interview. For longer interviews, find a comfortable way to sit or stand that prevents you from having to change your grip.  
                &bull; Make use of surfaces, especially something that can be used as a stand, to rest the recorder on at an acceptable distance from the audio source.  
                &bull; Look and listen for background sounds that can harm the quality of your recording when you first arrive at an interview or recording location.  
                &bull; Keep your audio files backed up and correctly labeled.
