                People are sensitive to having their photo taken. The more difficult the circumstance of the story, the more difficult it is to get a photograph. Our own biases and emotional investment in a story can make it difficult to make good choices about shooting photos.

                If you live in the community you cover, there are some unique challenges, such as:  
                &bull; Should you take photographs of people if they don’t want you to?  
                &bull; Should you publish very graphic images of violence and death?  
                &bull; Should you help someone who is injured or photograph them?  
                Every photojournalist must make these choices for him or herself within the professional and ethical boundaries that journalism allows.

                ## Make people comfortable  
                In breaking news situations, journalists are typically working frantically and have little time to build rapport. But, when shooting event stories, issue stories, or profiles, you need to warm people up. Explain how the photo will be used. Tell people a bit about yourself. Speak to them conversationally. All of these things may help you get a photo of people who are reluctant to be photographed. You may find that using a smartphone makes some people more comfortable, while others may take you less seriously.

                You must always be sensitive to the impact publishing images of people will have on those portrayed. Be sensitive when shooting those affected by tragedy or grief, especially children and people inexperienced with the media. Private people have a greater right to privacy than public officials and others who seek power, influence, or attention.

                ## Shoot for options  
                Even if a single image is going to be presented with a story or post, you want a variety of images from which to choose. In the case of difficult subject matter, images need to tell a story truthfully. They should not be gratuitous. When publishing graphic images, photographers need to consider the audience, the importance of the story, and the impact the images will have.

                Know yourself. Be aware of your biases and do not let them influence how you portray a situation or issue. Good photojournalists seek to capture the universal human elements of stories. Humanity is not defined by national boundary, tribe, politics, or province.

                Some situations are difficult to shoot because they are unsafe. No photograph is worth injury. When shooting in dangerous situations, always have an exit strategy. Be aware that soldiers and security forces may not wish to be photographed. Be smart about the risks.  
                Mental health is part of safety, too.  
                Only you can decide your limitations. Only you can decide if and when you should put down your camera and help. You will make a much better decisions if you think through your values before you find yourself in a high-pressure situation that requires you to make a decision on the spot.  
                Using a smartphone may encourage you to take greater risks, thinking you are less noticeable than shooters with large cameras. Be careful not to underestimate your level of risk.
