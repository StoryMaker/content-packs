                Before you begin to produce an audio piece, there are a few questions you should answer.  
                &bull; What is the most compelling way to tell your story? Is it a story about a specific event, person or issue? Determine whether the story focuses on recent events, the impact of the issue on society, or a story about an interesting person.  
                &bull; What is your angle? A good way to think about how to interestingly approach a topic is thinking how it actually affects ordinary people.  
                &bull; What audience are you aiming at? What are they interested in?  
                &bull; Can you present the story in an engaging, clear, and interesting manner? What different parts does your story consist of?  
                &bull; What audio do you want to record? Interviews, signature clips of relevant sounds, sounds that introduce the story?  
                &bull; What kind of time frame will you need in order to produce the story?

                Remember to ask yourself: Why are you making this program? Is there a specific audience you want to reach?  
                Leave sufficient time for editing and publishing. It is possible you will have to change your plan based on what clips and information you are able to collect.
