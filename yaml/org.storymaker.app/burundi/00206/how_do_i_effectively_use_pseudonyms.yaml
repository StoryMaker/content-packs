                If you or a source are threatened, you must take additional steps to protect the identity of the threatened individual. At-risk journalists and threatened sources often use pseudonyms to protect their true identities. When you communicate digitally, you can leave clues to your true identity.

                Those who maintain (or contribute to) a blog or an Internet forum need to be aware that their anonymity will not be guaranteed merely by signing with a pseudonym. Every blog entry records the IP address (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) of the computer it was sent from, and many ISPs (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISP) record all traffic that has passed through them. Therefore, if you are publishing sensitive information on a website, you must take precautions to not be found out. We discussed disguising your browsing in Lesson X.X. with Tor. If you must maintain anonymity online, be sure to use the Tor anonymity network to access your site and publish your content.

                ## Timestamps  
                If you publish media to a website about government activity in your country by using the Tor network, the authorities will not see that you were sending this information to a particular blog, but they might notice that whenever you enter an Internet café, a new post appears on the site. This can be linked to you, especially if your Internet café owner writes down your name and the time of your visit. To overcome this difficulty, ask a colleague from another country to post the blog for you. Use a secure webmail service (or encryption) to send the article to your colleague and ask him/her to wait for a while before publishing it on your blog.  
                Your identity can be determined not only by the name you choose for yourself or your source. Your identity can also be determined by the trail you leave through your online activity.
