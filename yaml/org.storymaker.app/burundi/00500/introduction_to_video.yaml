                Video is a very effective tool for telling a story. At its best, video combines the power of audio with the immediacy of photography to create a close connection with an audience.  
                It can also be overwhelming the first time you try to use it. But just like any tool, there are rules and practices you can learn to guide you through these first steps.

                We strongly suggest you complete the Security and Journalism curriculum before you begin. Those lessons are referenced in the Video section, but they deserve your undivided attention. Without them you are likely to put yourself and others at risk for poorly produced stories.
