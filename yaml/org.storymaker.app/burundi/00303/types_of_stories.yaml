                Depending on what your story is about and how you want to approach it, you should use different styles of audio production and presentation.  
                Sometimes you may find yourself in the middle of an event or a breaking story, which makes a specific style of audio reporting most useful for that situation. Alternatively, perhaps you are doing a profile piece or an issue story involving different witnesses and different voices, which calls for another approach.  
                While each situation can be approached in more than one way, here are some specific steps and guidelines you can follow in order to best present specific types of stories.

                A breaking news report (hard news) requires a piece of audio that explains what is happening, summarizing the key points, the main actors, and any information that is known so far. Because such reports are about something that may still be going on, sometimes there will be unanswered questions that will be addressed in follow-up reports. Breaking news stories may feature a reporter at the location of the action, with his/her voice explaining what is known so far and what can be seen on the ground from that vantage point. In some cases, a breaking news story may be introduced from a remote location based on secondhand reports when it is not possible to be there. It is crucial that you at least cover the following questions: Who, What, Where, Why, When, and How.

                Unlike breaking news stories, events are usually scheduled, which allows a reporter to prepare how he or she wants to tell a story beforehand. An audio report about an event should highlight the who, what, and why information. It is also useful to have interviews or comments from participants who can give additional information or observations. Events often have main participants such as honored guests or keynote speakers who you can contact before the event to schedule an interview. Even if you decide not to use the audio from those interviews, it is good to do them and have that audio as an option for your final piece.  
                As with most types of audio stories, you can use one voice as the narrator explaining what is happening and why. The narrator can be someone in a studio or someone on location introducing interviews and other information.
