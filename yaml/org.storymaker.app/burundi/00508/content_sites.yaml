                Distribution platforms vary in their nature, specifications and requirements. It is important to keep your options in mind when you are deciding where you would like to put your video for the most impact.  
                New sites are started and others disappear constantly, so this information is only a guideline to get you going.

                There are hundreds of commercial sites that allow you to publish your video online. One of the major disadvantages of many commercial platforms is that ads are placed next to your video. Many of these sites operate as online social networks.

                There are a number of nonprofit video sharing spaces focussed on social justice, environmental, or human rights issues.  
                Be aware of security issues not only for yourself, but for anyone in your videos when you publish them. Once you post a file online, you can never be sure you will be able to remove it. If your content is that risky, it is best to wait until a time when it is safer.

                ### YouTube  
                YouTube is the biggest video sharing site in the world. It is a fantastic way to reach a large audience. Ensure you have a promotional campaign to direct people to watch your video. There are so many videos on YouTube, it may be harder to reach and engage an audience there than in other spaces. Additionally, it can be hard to link people back to your site, and YouTube has used its Terms of Service to remove campaigning videos. In some countries YouTube is blocked.

                ### Vimeo  
                Vimeo has a slick user interface and does a great job of streaming higher-quality video. However, it falls short in terms of how the videos can be exported and displayed on external sites’ aggregators, and of search-friendliness.

                ### Facebook  
                If you are already running a campaign using Facebook, then sharing video on the site can be very powerful. The videos you post on Facebook are, however, largely limited in availability to the groups or campaigns you are connected to on the site.

                ### The Internet Archive  
                Archive.org contains thousands of digital movies that range from classic full-length films to daily alternative news broadcasts to videos of every genre uploaded by archive.org users. All of these movies are available for download, often in high resolution, and are freely licensed, so it is also a great place to find footage for use in production.
