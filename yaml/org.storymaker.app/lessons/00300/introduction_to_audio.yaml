                People love to tell each other stories. Sometimes these stories are handed down generation by generation. Spreading stories by spoken word is far older than radio.  
                Today audio is one of the most dominant forms of communication on the planet, and the tools and methods to create audio are more accessible than ever before. The audio curriculum provides the essential lessons you need to create good audio.

                We strongly suggest you complete the Security and Journalism curriculum before you begin. Those lessons are referenced in the Audio section, but they deserve your undivided attention. Without them, you are likely to put yourself and others at risk.
